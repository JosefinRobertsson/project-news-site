# News Site

My first Technigo bootcamp project, in the pre-course. The assignment was to build a responsive news site layout with css grid and flexbox.

## The problem

I had to learn everything from scratch so a lot of googling and trial and error! I took the example layout in the assignment description and tried to make it my own instead of making an exact copy. If I had more time I would try it the other way around, and use flexbox where I now have a grid layout and vice versa, just to see what I like better. I used the graceful degradation approach.
